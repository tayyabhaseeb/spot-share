# Verticode Take-Home Task

This project is a front-end only react typescript application. The objective and requirements are outlined below.

## Objective

Your task is to build a form to set up a project in a project management platform, then display that information on a project details page. You should design a typescript interface for the project data and place it in src/models/Project.ts.

Your form should allow the user to set up a project, and should include at a minimum the project name, description, and start date.

Once the user has submitted the form the application should display the information they entered in a project details page.

As a bonus task you can also add a status to the form and allow the user to mark the project as complete from the project details page.

This task is front end only, which means you don't need a database and don't need to store or persist the data.

## Typescript

This task uses typescript. You can find information about the basics of typescript and a typescript cheat sheet below.
